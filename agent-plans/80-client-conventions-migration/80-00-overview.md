# Client Conventions + Composability Migration - Master Plan

## Overview
Align the client codebase with `guides/client/*` conventions by migrating shared client utilities into `src/common`, consolidating feature `hooks.ts` and `schemas.ts`, and refactoring top composability offenders into feature/presentation layers. This plan pairs structural migration with targeted refactors on the largest pages/components.

## Overview Requirements (fill before delegating)
- [ ] `agent-plans/context.md` exists and is up to date (design system, ERD, refs)
- [ ] User stories exist in `agent-plans/user-stories/` and are referenced below
- [ ] Owners assigned for Server and Client workstreams
- [ ] Contract drafted (procedures/endpoints + DTO shapes + error shapes + auth)
- [ ] Primary UI surfaces listed (routes/pages/components) with acceptance notes
- [ ] Dependencies + parallelization identified (what can run in parallel)
- [ ] Success criteria + test expectations captured

### Completed Work (if any)
- None

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Shared client utilities | Move to `src/common` | Aligns with guides and separates client-safe code |
| Feature organization | `hooks.ts` + `schemas.ts` per feature | Enforces predictable structure |
| Refactor order | Booking + availability first | Highest complexity, reusable helpers |

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Broad import churn**: migrate utilities first, then consolidate hooks/schemas, then refactors.
- **Regression risk in large pages**: refactor behind feature components and keep UI tests/manual checks.
- **State coupling**: move URL state to feature hooks to avoid page-level logic.
